"""Script to extract the list of commands from the Onkyo protocol
documentation, which is an Excel file.

Since this Excel file is not designed to be read by machines, I don't
expect this to work for new versions of the file without adjustments.

Here's how the process is supposed to work:

    - This script takes the Excel document as a an input file, and
      converts it into a YAML.
    - This is checked into version control.
    - Adjustments to this file are required and made, via version control.
    - Subsequently, a new version of the Excel file can be parsed into YAML
      and merged with the manual changes.
    - The YAML file is used by the Python library for the final command list;
      potentially be further generating a Python file from it for speed.
